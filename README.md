# teneva_bm


## Description

Benchmarks library for tensor based multidimensional approximation and optimization methods. This library is based on a software product [teneva](https://github.com/AndreiChertkov/teneva). See also related collection of various optimization methods [teneva_opti](https://github.com/AndreiChertkov/teneva_opti).


## Installation

The package requires the [Python](https://www.python.org) programming language of the version >= 3.8. Please, install manually [numpy](https://numpy.org) (1.22+) and [scipy](https://www.scipy.org) (1.8+). To use the `pytorch` and `jax` versions of the code, you should also install [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) (1.13+) and [jax[cpu]](https://github.com/google/jax) (0.4.3+) respectively. You can do it with the following command: `pip install numpy==1.22.1 scipy==1.8.1 torch==1.13.1 "jax[cpu]"==0.4.3`.

Then the package can be installed via pip: `pip install teneva_bm`. It can be also downloaded from the repository [teneva_bm](https://github.com/AndreiChertkov/teneva_bm) and installed by `python setup.py install` command from the root folder of the project.
